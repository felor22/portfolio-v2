                            <h3>Challenge</h3>
                            <p>Manurewa Marae is a large community grassroots organization that offers a range of free services, from exercise classes to a youth-empowerment program. However not enough people in the community were aware that these services existed. One source of the problem was their website, which was disorganized and outdated, making it difficult and confusing for users to find information. My task was to rethink the IA and flow of their site in a way that would foster more effective user engagement.</p>

                        <h3 class="pink-title">Process</h3>
                        <p>Initially I held stakeholder meetings with each sub-group of Manurewa Marae in order to better understand the multifaceted organization and their goals. Since I was living and working in the community, I was able to conduct informal interviews with community members who access the site and observe their needs firsthand.</p>
                        <p>Drawing from my ethnographic research, I created a sitemap based on the main services provided by the organization. I decided to organize the site categorically in this way as it immediately brings awareness to the range of services available as well as acting as a helpful guide for the user. A static navigation with drop-down menus also ensured an intuitive flow of information while keeping the site uncluttered and easy to navigate.</p>

                        <figure class="case-images">

                        </figure>
                        <p>Since most services were provided by groups that had partnered with the marae, but were still distinct entities on their own, I structured each service as a one-page site, with a cohesive format shared by all of them.</p>

                        <figure class="case-images left">

                        </figure>
                        <p>In addition I worked on how to incorporate other media elements into the site and display content in a way that would best convey Manurewa Marae’s brand and story.</p>

                        <p>By immersing myself in the local culture I was able to better empathize with and understand the needs of the community, allowing me to create a product that would have a positive impact on their lives.</p>
                        <p>The new architecture of the site aligned with both the organization’s goal of increasing the number of community members who engaged with these services as well as the needs of users to find the information they need quickly and easily. The updated site also better communicated the story of Manurewa Marae and their community-driven mission.</p>
                        <p>We received very positive feedback from the community regarding the new website and also saw a marked increase in participation in the services offered by Manurewa Marae.</p>
